# Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Prediction Model 🫀❤️🩺

## 📌 Problem Statement
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for nearly 17.9 million deaths annually (WHO). Early detection and risk assessment can save lives by enabling timely medical intervention. However, predicting CVD risk accurately is challenging due to complex interactions between medical, genetic, and lifestyle factors.

This project develops a machine learning model to predict CVD risk using patient health data, providing data-driven insights for early diagnosis and preventive healthcare strategies.
<br><br><br>

## 🎯 Objectives
✔ Build & compare multiple ML models to predict CVD risk with high accuracy. <br>
✔ Identify key risk factors (e.g., blood pressure, cholesterol, lifestyle habits).<br>
✔ Optimize model performance using feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.<br>
✔ Explore deployment potential for real-world medical applications.<br>
<br><br><br>

## 📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains 70,000 patient records with 11 clinical features, including:
### Key Features: <b>
- Demographics: Age, Gender
####   Medical Indicators:
- Blood Pressure (Systolic & Diastolic)
- Cholesterol Levels
- Glucose Levels
#### Lifestyle Factors:
- Smoking Status
- Alcohol Consumption
- Physical Activity
#### Target Variable:
- Cardio (Binary: 1 = CVD, 0 = No CVD)
#### 🔗 Dataset Source: [Kaggle - Cardiovascular Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset)
<br><br><br>

## 🛠 Skills & Technologies Used
### 📌 Programming & Tools
- Python (Primary Language)
- Jupyter Notebook (Interactive Analysis)
- Git & GitHub (Version Control)

### 📌 Key Libraries
- Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
- Visualization:	Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Machine Learning:	Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Linear Regression, Decision Tree)
- Model Evaluation:	Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ANOVA, Confusion Matrix


### 📌 Model Development Workflow
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) → Data Cleaning → Feature Engineering
2. Model Training & Evaluation (Scikit-Learn, and Measurement)
3. Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV)
4. Feature Importance Analysis (SHAP, Random Forest Feature Importance)
<br><br><br>

## ⚠ Limitations & Challenges
1. Imbalanced Data → Class distribution may bias predictions.
2. Missing Features → Genetic history, stress levels, and diet data are absent.
3. Deployment Readiness → Needs API/Web App integration for real-world use.
<br><br><br>

## 🚀 Future Improvements
✅ Advanced Feature Engineering → Incorporate Family history, Genetic history, stress levels and more. 
<br>
✅ Handling Class Imbalance → Use SMOTE or weighted class approaches. 
<br>
✅ Hyperparameter Optimization → Bayesian Optimization for better tuning. 
<br>
✅ Model Deployment → Flask/Django API for healthcare integration. 
<br>
✅ Explainable AI (XAI) → SHAP/LIME for doctor-friendly interpretations
